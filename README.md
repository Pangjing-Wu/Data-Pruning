# Data Pruning
This is a repository that reimplements existing popular data pruning methods by `PyTorch`.

    It is an ongoing project, and there may be some errors in my code, because I can only reimplement it based on my understanding of its papers for some methods. So, please feel free to contact me if you find any bug or you have any suggestions.

## Requirements
* pytorch = 1.13.0
* torchvision = 0.14.0

## Inculded Methods
